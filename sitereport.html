  <p align="justify"> HTML is a very interesting and simple language that is easy to learn but difficult to master. It was always intriguing to me that, how all those attractive web pages are developed and made interactive with beautiful colors and fonts. After studying this module, a lot of those confusions were clear.  I’m aware that there are still advance functionalities of web development is to learn but I’ve become familiar to the basic terms of web development which is HTML and CSS. </p>
  <p align="justify">While learning the web basic web development, coding, design and debugging process, I got to understand how different type of codes work. I understood that every set of code has their own functionality and area of implementation. While doing this project, at some point I had difficulties with the code use. I was unable to choose the code that is suitable and required in a certain field. I also had problem with the proper use of code structure and understanding the importance of code quality. So, in order to solve my problems and clear my confusion, I consulted my module tutor and did some research in the related field. After clearing my confusion I was quite confident to perform this project.</p>
  <p align="justify">While developing the webpage, I decided to keep it nice and simple. I didn’t want to add any vivid colors to the pages so I went with darker colors and choose feasible color combination. I choose the font that is sophisticated and easy to read without putting any eye strain to the users such as, Arial. I wanted to make a simple and responsive webpage that is accessible in all devices. So, the UI of the webpage is responsive and easy to use and understand. I took help from the module tutor and other online resources for responsive code design.  </p>
  <p align="justify">Similarly, websites like W3school provided a huge support while performing this project. It is a really helpful site with complete solution to HTML and CSS. Along with that various other internet sources and formuns helped me get a solution when an error was encountered. While i was doing the porject, at one moment i was unable to create two colums for my CV. At that moment W3school helped me understand the method and solved my problem. Similarly, forums like Stack overflow help me with various other minor problems that I faced while doing the project. Images used in the Portfolio Section were taken from Pixabay, which is a website that provides free images for personal and commercial use.</p>
